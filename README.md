A Dart package created to wrap `Dart Isolates` with more easy-to-use API as well as to add support of `Web Workers`. Implementation is strongly inspired by iOS GCD Framework.

**TODO:**

1) Add web support to both new `web` and `js_interop` environment and legacy `html/js`.
2) Document code and add examples
